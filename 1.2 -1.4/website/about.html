  <h1>ABOUT US </h1>
  <img  src="./image/cart.jpg" alt="">
 <div class="about-text" >
    <p>  We’re the UK’s  5th largest supermarket chain. We’ve just opened our 950th store and we plan to open a new store each
  week, on average. (Not to mention our growing global presence.) But we know our success has only been possible thanks to
  our amazing Harris colleagues. That's why we celebrate everyone's achievements, offer competitive pay and create great
  working environments. And that's how we've become a multi award-winning employer - but it's the least we can do. We know
  that our people make Harris mean even more.</p>
