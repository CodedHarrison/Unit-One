<h3>About Us</h3>
 <img src="./image/harry.jpeg" alt="" width="250px">
<P>We’re helping UK organisations build a stronger workforce. We help businesses and individuals to boost their talent and
skills by combining real jobs with on and off the job training.</P>
<h4>Improving outcomes for organisations and individuals through apprenticeships</h4>
Apprenticeships are a great way to build a motivated, skilled workforce by providing people with real employment
alongside on and off the job training.

Organisations can recruit apprentices at all levels, from entry-level vocational roles to executive leadership roles
that are vital to succession planning. The wide range of apprentice programmes we offer means you can attract a broad,
diverse range of talent to your organisation.

Today’s apprenticeships help support employee learning over several years, increasing employee engagement and retention.
An apprenticeship scheme can also reduce overall learning and development costs, thanks to the apprenticeship levy.

At Capita we offer a range of apprenticeship programmes from Level 2 to Level 6 to support your business in developing
the workforce of the future. Whether it’s entry level customer service, senior management or specialist skills, we can
deliver apprenticeship programmes to meet your needs.
